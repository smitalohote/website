        Many public schools provide a free education through the government.
        Parents may send their own children to a private schools, but they must
        pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school,
        because their countries do not make education available in their
        countries, or because their families do not have enough money, or
        because the children have to work for money, or because the society have
        negative prejudice on education for girls.The city of Alexandria in
        Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the
        intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of
        Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations
        suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of
        Rome in CE 476.
